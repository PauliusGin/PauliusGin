### Hi there, I'm Paulius.

âœ¨ Former chef turned dedicated stay-at-home dad and now an aspiring coder, aiming for a transition into the tech industry :raised_hands:

âœ¨ I'm currently going through a full-stack Javascript bootcamp, working on a couple of personal projects and just devouring everything coding-related with an passion.

âœ¨ This page is an archive of my coding journey and it will remain a testament to my wins, losses and ongoing progress as a developer.
